# [AssetTracker](https://github.com/DevlanCodingPlayground/AssetTracker)

An asset management system is a software application or set of tools that organizations use to track and manage their physical and digital assets. These assets can include things like equipment, vehicles, buildings, and computer hardware and software.

The main purpose of an asset management system is to provide a centralized location for storing and retrieving information about an organization's assets. This information can include details such as the asset's make and model, serial number, purchase date, and current location.

Asset management systems can also include features such as tracking maintenance schedules, monitoring asset usage and tracking depreciation. This information can be used to make informed decisions about when to replace or upgrade assets.

Open-source **AssetTracker** Crafted using Flask and a theme named  **[Datta Able](https://appseed.us/product/datta-able/flask/)**
